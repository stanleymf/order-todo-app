## [1.4.3] - 2025-01-13

### üîÑ **Saved Products Sync System**

- **New Sync Script**: Created comprehensive sync system to sync saved products from local SQLite database to D1 database.
- **Upsert Operations**: Implemented safe "upsert" (insert or update) operations that preserve existing data and only add/update products as needed.
- **Missing POST Endpoint**: Added the missing `/api/tenants/:tenantId/saved-products` POST endpoint to the worker that was preventing product saving functionality.
- **Sync Script Features**:
  - Generates SQL scripts for safe database operations
  - Supports tenant-specific syncing with `--tenant-id` parameter
  - Dry-run mode for testing without making changes
  - Batch processing for large datasets
  - Comprehensive logging and progress tracking
- **Script Usage**: Added `npm run sync-saved-products` command for easy execution.
- **Data Preservation**: Sync operations use `INSERT OR REPLACE` to ensure no data loss unless explicitly requested.

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

- **Worker Endpoint**: Added POST endpoint for saving products that was missing from the worker implementation.
- **Database Service**: Leverages existing `d1DatabaseService.saveProducts()` method for consistent data handling.
- **Script Architecture**: Created modular sync system with:
  - `SavedProductsSync` class for core sync logic
  - SQL script generation for safe execution
  - Command-line argument parsing
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

### üéØ **Impact**

- **Product Management**: Users can now successfully save products from Shopify to their local database.
- **Data Synchronization**: Provides safe way to sync local product data to production D1 database.
- **Development Workflow**: Enables local development with SQLite and production deployment with D1.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures no existing product data is lost during sync operations.

## [1.4.2] - 2025-01-13

### üîß **Critical Webhook Display Fix**

- **Fixed Webhook Count Display Issue**: Resolved critical issue where webhook registration was working but the UI showed "0 webhooks" after registration.
- **Root Cause Identified**: The problem was caused by inconsistent database function usage across API endpoints:
  - Webhook registration used `getStore()` ‚Üí returned correct data with webhooks ‚úÖ
  - Frontend refresh used `/api/tenants/:tenantId/stores` ‚Üí called `getShopifyStores()` ‚Üí returned incomplete data ‚ùå
- **Database Function Consistency**: Updated all store-related endpoints to use `getStores()` instead of `getShopifyStores()`:
  - `/api/tenants/:tenantId/stores` - Now returns complete store objects with parsed settings
  - `/api/tenants/:tenantId/test-shopify` - Updated for consistency
  - `/api/tenants/:tenantId/orders-by-date` - Updated for proper store data structure
- **Settings Parsing**: The `getStores()` function properly parses the JSON `settings` column from the database, including the `webhooks` array.
- **Data Structure Consistency**: All endpoints now return consistent store objects with:
  - Properly parsed settings including webhooks
  - Complete store configuration data
  - Consistent field naming and structure

### üîß **Technical Details**

- **Function Difference**: 
  - `getShopifyStores()` - Returns raw database fields, no settings parsing, no webhooks
  - `getStores()` - Returns complete Store objects with parsed settings including webhooks
- **Database Schema**: The `shopify_stores` table stores webhook configurations in the JSON `settings` column
- **API Response**: Store objects now include `settings.webhooks` array with registration status and timestamps

### üéØ **Impact**

- **Webhook Status Display**: UI now correctly shows the number of registered webhooks
- **Store Management**: All store-related functionality now uses consistent data structures
- **API Reliability**: Eliminated data inconsistency between different store endpoints
- **User Experience**: Users can now see accurate webhook registration status after setup

## [1.4.1] - 2025-01-13

### üîß **Critical Runtime Error Fixes**

- **Fixed 500 Internal Server Errors**: Resolved critical runtime errors that were causing all application routes to return 500 Internal Server Errors.
- **Removed Problematic Code**: Cleaned up worker code by removing:
  - Development environment checks using `process.env` (not available in Cloudflare Workers)
  - Unimplemented database service methods (`resetDailyUploadGoals`, `syncProductFromWebhook`, etc.)
  - Missing type definitions (`ExportedHandler`, `DurableObjectState`, `WebSocketPair`)
  - Unused webhook handling functions and Durable Object classes
- **Simplified Static Asset Serving**: Streamlined static asset serving to use only the Cloudflare Workers `ASSETS` binding.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the worker.

### üîß **Critical Static Asset Serving Fix**

- **Fixed 404 Errors for All Routes**: Resolved critical issue where all application routes were returning 404 errors due to incorrect static asset serving configuration.
- **Cloudflare Workers Asset Binding**: Fixed static asset serving to properly use the `ASSETS` binding instead of incorrect `serveStatic` configuration.
- **SPA Routing Support**: Implemented proper SPA routing that serves `index.html` for client-side routes while allowing API routes to pass through.
- **Asset Fallback Logic**: Added fallback logic to serve `index.html` when static assets are not found, enabling proper client-side routing.

### üîß **Shopify Order Fetching Fix**

- **Fixed "Fetch Orders from Shopify" Functionality**: Resolved critical issue in Settings > Order Card where the "Fetch Orders from Shopify" feature was not working due to API parameter mismatch.
- **ShopifyApiService Update**: Updated `getOrders()` method in `ShopifyApiService` to accept optional filtering parameters (`name` and `status`) to support order lookup functionality.
- **API Parameter Support**: The `getOrders()` method now properly handles:
  - Order name filtering for specific order lookup
  - Status filtering (any, open, closed, cancelled)
  - Backward compatibility with existing calls
- **Worker Endpoint Fix**: Fixed the `/api/tenants/:tenantId/stores/:storeId/orders/by_name` endpoint to properly use the updated `getOrders()` method.
- **Import Statement Fix**: Corrected import statement for `d1DatabaseService` to use the proper export name.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-06-23

### üóÑÔ∏è **Critical Database Fix**

- **Missing `shopify_stores` Table**: Fixed a critical issue where the `shopify_stores` table was missing from the database, causing all store management functionality to fail.
- **Database Migration**: Created and applied migration `0009_create_shopify_stores_table.sql` to create the missing table with proper schema:
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `tenant_id` - Foreign key to tenants table
  - `shopify_domain` - Store domain (e.g., my-store.myshopify.com)
  - `access_token` - Shopify API access token
  - `webhook_secret` - Webhook verification secret
  - `sync_enabled` - Boolean flag for sync status
  - `settings` - JSON field for webhook configurations and other settings
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_sync_at` - Timestamps
- **Performance Indexes**: Added proper indexes for efficient querying:
  - Index on `tenant_id` for tenant-specific queries
  - Index on `shopify_domain` for domain lookups
  - Index on `sync_enabled` for filtering active stores
  - Unique constraint on `(tenant_id, shopify_domain)` to prevent duplicates
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Added proper foreign key relationship to `tenants` table with CASCADE delete

### üîß **Impact**

- **Store Management**: Users can now successfully add, edit, and manage Shopify stores
- **Webhook Registration**: Store webhook registration now works properly
- **API Testing**: "Test Connection" functionality is now operational
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Proper tenant isolation for store configurations

### üêõ **Root Cause**

- The `shopify_stores` table was referenced in multiple migrations (0012, etc.) but never actually created
- Backend code expected the table to exist, causing 401 errors and failed store operations
- This was a critical infrastructure issue that prevented core functionality

## [0.2.3] - 2025-06-23
